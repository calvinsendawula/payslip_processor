### Notes from Last Supervision Meeting

During our last meeting on July 15, 2023, we discussed Angsar's career progression and interest in moving toward a technical architect role. We've identified the following steps to support this transition:

1. Shadow the current Solution Architect for the next enterprise project
2. Complete the System Design and Architecture certification by Q1 next year
3. Lead the upcoming API gateway redesign project
4. Represent the Engineering department in the cross-functional Cloud Strategy meetings

Michael believes Angsar has strong potential for the Technical Architect track and will provide necessary resources and exposure to help her succeed in this path.

### Training Recommendations

Based on Angsar's career goals, the following additional training resources are recommended:

1. Enterprise Architecture Patterns Workshop
2. Technical Communication and Presentation Skills
3. Cloud Cost Optimization Strategies
4. Cross-functional Team Leadership

### Additional Notes

Angsar has requested flexible working hours during the next month to accommodate a personal development course that takes place on Thursday evenings. This request has been approved by management.

The Engineering department will be relocating to Building B in October. Angsar has been assigned office B-342 and will be responsible for coordinating the migration of the Backend Services team's equipment.
